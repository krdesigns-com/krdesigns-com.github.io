description: With the announcement of Laravel Dusk, a browser automation and testing API tool, I noticed a cool chunk of demo code. It represents a realtime app that features user interacting using WebSockets
             This inspired me to build an app for which I could use that same exact snippet of code. It ended up involving quite a few steps, but Laravel made it easy!
